# Running the Benchmarks

The .NET 8 SDK as well as Python are required to run the benchmarks.  The following instructions will be using Chocolatey as a package manager for Windows.  Chocolatey can be installed using the [Chocolatey install guide](https://chocolatey.org/install#individual) if it isn't already installed.

```powershell
choco install dotnet-sdk python git.install
```

Once the prerequisites are installed, or if they have already been installed by other means, you can clone the repo to get a copy of the code.
fsdf
